1)
Set the total inputted values to zero
Set counter to one

request an postive integer from the user

if the integer is negative, 
print "error, please input a positive integer"

if the integer is postive,
input the integer
print "correct, continue adding postive integers"

Add the integer to the total inputted values
Create a variable "largest_integer"to calculate the largest inputted value

if the integer ends in a 0 value, 
print "Algorithm finished, thanks.Largest number was "largest_integer". "



2)
request user's name
Store user's name in variable "first_name"
print "first_name Hello, World"

3) 
set the total average to zero
set the counter to one
add the integer total average 
Calculate the integer total average divided by the number of total number of counters.
Print out the integer total average  

4) 
request shopping list of apples,bananas, grapes, butter, bread, milk. (note apples, butter, bread, milk are still left to buy) 
print " Input a positive integer if already bought, otherwise input a negative integer if still left to buy".
if the integer is negative, print "still left to buy"
Arrange negative integers in alphabetical order (so apples, bread, butter, milk)

5) 
input X integer(e.g. 1)
input Y integer (e.g. 2)

calculate S_integer by adding X and Y integers (1+2=3)
calculate A_ integer by dividing S_ integer in half (3/2= 1.5)
calculate P_ integer by multiplying X and Y integers (1x2=2)

if S_integer, A integer_,P_integer are completed, then print "S_integer, A_integer, P_integer)
